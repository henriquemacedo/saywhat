## ⚠️ Disclamair

This project was built in the context of [ETH Lisbon](https://www.ethlisbon.org), a three-day Ethereum-focused hackathon.

To know more about the ***Smart What ?!*** project, look at the project page at [taikai.network/ethlisbon](https://taikai.network/ethlisbon/hackathons/ethlisbon-2022/projects/cl9slqpm144092101zc25lw0c5j).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
